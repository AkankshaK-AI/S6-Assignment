Applying the regularization technuques of Group Norm, Layer Norm, L1 over the MNIST dataset

In L1 reg, we have taken the lambda value as 0.001

Findings:
Group norm:- The accuracy is good with around 99.3% consistently in the last few epochs
Batch Norm:- Accuracy is very good with it touching hitting 99.4% multiple times

The model aslo shows the misclassified images
